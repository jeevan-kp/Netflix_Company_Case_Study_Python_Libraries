**Approach**:

●  Defining Problem Statement and Analysing basic metrics 

●  Observations on the shape of data, data types of all the attributes, conversion of categorical attributes to 'category' (If required), missing value detection, statistical summary 

●  Non-Graphical Analysis: Value counts and unique attributes ​​

●  Visual Analysis - Univariate, Bivariate after pre-processing of the data

Note: Pre-processing involves unnesting of the data in columns like Actor, Director, Country

    ●  For continuous variable(s): Distplot, countplot, histogram for univariate analysis 

    ●  For categorical variable(s): Boxplot 

    ●  For correlation: Heatmaps, Pairplots 

●  Missing Value & Outlier check (Treatment optional) 

●  Insights based on Non-Graphical and Visual Analysis 

    ●  Comments on the range of attributes

    ●  Comments on the distribution of the variables and relationship between them

    ●  Comments for each univariate and bivariate plot

●  Business Insights  - Should include patterns observed in the data along with what you can infer from it

●  Recommendations  - Actionable items for business. No technical jargon. No complications. Simple action items that everyone can understand
